# Signal-Generator
On MATLAB
The program help the user to plot the required signal, and then the user is able to perform operations on this signal.
The user inputs the sampling frequency and the start and end time of the signal.
Then, he enters the breakpoints required on the time axis.
The program between each 2 breakpoints ask the user about the type of signal he wants to plot and its specifications.
The signal can be: DC, Ramp, General Polynomial, Exponential, Sinusoidal.
The signal is plotted automatically and the user can perform some operations on the signal: Amplitude or time scaling, shifting, reflecting.
It has to be noted that the user can perform as many operations as he wants on the same signals. He can plot multiple signals too until he decides to quit.
